      IMPORTANT: This is a &quot;bash&quot; script. It will
      probably fail if used under another shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is an update from an earlier version of this script,
      it is strongly that this script be run with the [-c] command
      line option to insure it is configured correctly. In additon,
      any existing configuration files should either be rebuilt
      using the &quot;-e &lt;name&gt;&quot; option or deleted and
      recreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time this script is initialised, it will run its
      basic configuration routine and exit. If you ever want to
      reconfigure the script, use the [-c] command line option to
      erase and create a default config file. Use [-C &lt;name&gt;]
      to create a new config section (after the default is
      created).

      This script was written using &#8249;Bash-4.1.9&#8250;. While
      it may work correctly with other scripting languages, there
      is no guarantee that it will.

      <li>This script probably has to be run as ROOT or another
      privileged user who has proper READ/WRITE permissions to the
      &quot;/etc&quot; directory as well as the Clamav
      database.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>This script has an interactive configuration function.
      You must run it from the console the first time you invoke
      it. After that, it will work fine from CRON.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The [-C] option will create a new configuration for use
      by the script. Use it from the command line. EXAMPLE:
      scamp.sh -C<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The [-e] option will edit an existing config file. The
      file must be stated on the command line: scamp.sh -e
      &lt;filename&gt;. Filename is what you want to call the new
      config file. Use only letters, numbers and underscores. No
      special characters allowed. If the section does not exist, it
      will be created. The config-script will ask the same
      questions as when you first installed the script. When
      finished, it will exit. To use your new config section, just
      call it from the command line like you did when you created
      it. It will use the configuration file named. You should NOT
      give the confiruration file a &#39;prefix&#39;. It is not
      required.REMEMBER: The name is case sensitive!<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The &quot;scamp.sh&quot; file is a BASH script for
      downloading and installing various Clamav definition files.
      The script will create a &quot;CONFIGURATION FILE&quot; when
      first run. The majority of the variables are &#39;hard
      coded&#39; into the script. The only one that must be entered
      is the location of the Clamav database. See your
      &quot;clamd.conf&quot; file for the correct location.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>Examples are:<br>
        a. /var/db/clamav<br>
        b. /var/lib/clamav<br>
        c. /usr/local/share/clamav<br>
        <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>You must enter the correct location or else the script
      will not work. The initialization will only occur the first
      time the script is run or when invoked by a command line
      options [-c].<br>
        <br>

      When available, lower case letter will turn an option off,
      while upper case will activate the function. Presently, only
      the &#39;log&#39; and &#39;summary screen&#39; and
      &#39;random download timer&#39; functions are supported. They
      can be set permanently in the config file.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTE: &quot;Random Download Timer&quot;<br>
      The random download function is only useful when the script
      is run via CRON. It is ignored at other times. The function
      can be invoked via the command line using [-R]; i.e.,
      &quot;scamp.sh -R&quot; for instance. You can save the
      setting permanently in the config file by running the script
      with the [-c] command line option and then answering the
      random download question with either 1 or 0 - 0=off &amp;
      1=on.

      INSTALLATION NOTES:<br>
      <br>
      1. All of the Sanesecurity files and gpg keys are now keep in
      the<br>
      Sanesecurity (sane) directory.<br>
      <br>
      2. For the safest and most error free operation, I would
      recommend<br>
      cleaning out the clamav database directory of all files and
      directories<br>
      not installed by the &#39;freshclam&#39; program itself. This
      appears to be even<br>
      more important if you have been running another script to
      update the<br>
      clamav database.<br>
      <br>
      3. That would probably include all BUT these files:<br>
      a. daily.cld<br>
      b. main.cld<br>
      c. mirrors.dat<br>
      d. stats.dat<br>
      <br>
      4. Any directories should also be deleted.<br>
      <br>
      5. Running the script for the first time after cleaning out
      the clamav<br>
      database will insure a cleaner install of the new database
      files. Since<br>
      it appears that different &#39;scripts&#39; install a
      radically different<br>
      configuration of definition files, this would also insure
      that only the<br>
      ones installed by this script are made available to Clamav.
      It would also<br>
      insure that outdated files are removed.<br>
      <br>
      The actual files download and installed by this script
      include the following.

      This script is easily run via CRON. Something like this is
      all that you probably need. You should probably include a
      &quot;MAILTO&quot; in the crontab file. Any errors will be
      mailed to that address. If not all ready set, or if you do
      not know how to set it, at the command line enter:
      &quot;whoami&quot; sans quotes and enter that in the mailto
      variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      EXAMBLE: Output of &#39;whoami&#39; was steve. Place this in
      the top of the cron file:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#160;&#160;&#160;MAILTO=steve
    </p>
    <p>
      This would be placed just below the &#39;SHELL&#39; variable.

      FreeBSD Note:<br>
      <br>
      When installed via the FreeBSD ports system, a configuration
      file with<br>
      the basic defaults for Clamav on a FreeBSD system is
      installed in the<br>
      &#39;/usr/local/etc/scamp&#39; directory. It is still
      strongly recommended that the<br>
      first time this script is run, it is run as &quot;scamp.sh
      -c&quot; to insure the<br>
      file is configured according to the end users
      preferences.<br>
