INSTALL

1. Place the "scamp.sh" script in a directory available in the PATH
   setting.

2. Change the file permissions: "chmod 0755 scamp.sh" or whatever is
   acceptable for your system

3. The first time the program is run, it needs to create a "config"
   file. Either run the program from the console or use the [-c] command
   line option to force building a new "config" file.

4. This script is probably best used via CRON. Running every 4 hours
   is probably sufficient.

5. When run via CRON, using the "-R -L -q" options will provide a log
   file, random download intervals and suppress superfluous emails from
   CRON regarding the script's progress. Error messages will still be
   supplied, however.

6. PLEASE read the "README" file prior to actually running this
   script. It contains important information.


NOTE: FreeBSD Users

If installed via the FreeBSD ports system, a preconfigured "config"
has been created: "/usr/local/etc/scamp/default". While this is
sufficient for most users, it is still strongly recommended that the
user run the script with the [-c] command line option the first time
this script is started. This will insure a custom config file suited
to the end users specifications.
